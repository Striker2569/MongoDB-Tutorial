    "> Theory:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is transaction?\n",
    " \n",
    " Transaction is a sequence of one or more operations that are executed as a single unit of work. the operations can either be completed successfully or fail completely. The primary goal is to ensure data integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "For a transactions to be considered complete, it must satisfy the **ACID** properties:\n",
    "1. `Atomicity`: All operations within a transaction are completed successfully, or none are.\n",
    "2. `Consistency`: A transaction will bring the database from one consistent state to another.\n",
    "3. `Isolation`: Transactions are isolated from each other until they're finished.\n",
    "4. `Durability`: Once a transaction is committed, it remains committed even in the face of system failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why MongoDB Transactions?\n",
    "\n",
    " While MongoDB has been traditionally seen as a NoSQL database that didn't support multi-document transactions, since version 4.0, it has introduced support for multi-document transactions. This allows MongoDB to combine multiple operations into a single ACID transaction."

    "```\n",
    "This is the core of your transaction. The Function `'callback'` defines the series of operations that should be executed within the transaction. Each operation will be perfmored atomically.\n",

    "Here, `Session` is the client session associated with the transaction. All operations inside the transaction must reference this session.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Inside your callback function:\n",

    "1. **Defining collections:**\n",

    "    ```Python\n",
    "    accounts_collection = session.client.bank.accounts\n",
    "    transfers_collection = session.client.bank.transfers\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    You are accessing the 'accounts' and 'transfers' collection with bank database\n",

    "2. **Building the transfer Document:**\n",

    "    ```\n",
