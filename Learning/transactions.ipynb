    "What is transaction?\n",
    " \n",
    " Transaction is a sequence of one or more operations that are executed as a single unit of work. the operations can either be completed successfully or fail completely. The primary goal is to ensure data integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "For a transactions to be considered complete, it must satisfy the **ACID** properties:\n",
    "1. `Atomicity`: All operations within a transaction are completed successfully, or none are.\n",
    "2. `Consistency`: A transaction will bring the database from one consistent state to another.\n",
    "3. `Isolation`: Transactions are isolated from each other until they're finished.\n",
    "4. `Durability`: Once a transaction is committed, it remains committed even in the face of system failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why MongoDB Transactions?\n",
    "\n",
    " While MongoDB has been traditionally seen as a NoSQL database that didn't support multi-document transactions, since version 4.0, it has introduced support for multi-document transactions. This allows MongoDB to combine multiple operations into a single ACID transaction."
